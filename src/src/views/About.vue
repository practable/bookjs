<h1>Learning Analytics Notice</h1>

<p>We collect logs of interactions (e.g. clicks and inputs) with our remote laboratory user interfaces. These logs are necessary for the provision of educational tools (e.g. automated formative feedback) and are used for educational research. Interaction logs contain a unique ‘userName’ that is stored in localStorage on your browser and is a random string of letters and numbers. This ‘userName’ is persistent so that you can close and reopen the browser and our educational tools can continue to provide appropriate services. You can clear the ‘userName’ from localStorage but this will limit the effectiveness of the educational tools provided. The processing of interaction data is performed under the lawful basis of ‘legitimate interest’ as no sensitive personal data is collected and it is unlikely that the ‘userName’ could be used to personally identify any user of the system. For more details see the <a href="https://registryservices.ed.ac.uk/academic-services/policies-regulations/learning-and-assessment/learning-analytics/policy">University of Edinburgh’s Learning Analytics policy</a>.</p>

<p>Processed interaction data cannot be used as the basis for personal educational interventions unless you provide prior consent. If you volunteer to take part in research projects that use these remote laboratories, and where personal data is requested (e.g. via surveys), then your voluntary consent will be required in order to associate any interaction data with your personal data.</p>

<h1>Cookie Notice</h1>

This site asks your browser to store a randomly-generated code (made up of letters and numbers) in local storage (a ‘userName’). This ‘userName’ is essential to navigating the site and securely booking out experiments. The ‘userName’ is persistant, so that you can close and reopen your browser and retain access to any experiments you have booked. You can remove the ‘userName’ at any time, by clearing your cache, however, you will lose access to any experiments you have booked. A new ‘userName’ will be generated the next time you use the site. This ‘userName’ is a strictly necessary cookie, so we are exempted from asking for your consent. For more information on strictly necessary cookies please see this <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies/what-are-the-rules-on-cookies-and-similar-technologies/#rules9">ICO guide</a>.

<h1>About Practable</h1>

<p>
This is the booking interface for the <a href="https://practable.io">practable.io</a> non-traditional practical work system, hosted by the University of Edinburgh. </p>

	<h3> For Users </h3>

	<p>The booking system, and the <a href="https://practable.io">practable.io</a> system itself, are under active development. You will notice functional and cosmetic changes over time. These should be largely self-explanatory.</p>
	

	<p> It's entirely possible you will find the odd issue, despite our best efforts to eliminate them. A simple page reload, or returning to the original link you received, should fix most of the issues that might crop up. We'd be delighted to hear from you if you have any other issues, or feedback. Just drop us a line at <a href="mailto:support@practable.io">support@practable.io</a> with as much detail as you can manage.</p>	  

	<h3> For Educators </h3>
	
	<p> Practable is the core reference implemention of an emerging consensus regarding the role of remote laboratories in on-campus education. Some of the background can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/23752696.2020.1816845">here</a>.</p>

	<h3> Adopters and Developers</h3>
	<p>	If you are a potential adopter or developer of federated remote laboratory technologies, you might be pleasantly surprised to find that all the code and hardware is open-source, for the complete feature set. We will continue to develop the code base in the open.  We value the opportunity to create educational software which reflects our values. We hope you do too.</p>

	<p> If you want to take a quick look at the software, you can find the core <a href="https://github.com/practable/relay">here</a>. Developer and adopter documentation is on our roadmap, as are support tools and services to set you up and/or keep you going / scale up. Alternatively, we can do some or all of the work for you - get in touch to discuss the options without obligation. If you have any questions, want to discuss getting some help, or simply want to let us know you might be interested in participating in the practable ecosystem in some way, let us know by emailing <a href="mailto:timothy.drysdale@ed.ac.uk">Tim</a>.</p>
