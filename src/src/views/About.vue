<h1>About</h1>

<p> This is a proof-of-concept booking system for developers and course staff to explore the activities in their current state of development. Further refinements are expected, including the addition of features and minor/cosmetic changes to existing features. Expect changes in the way that you authenticate to the system, to make it more convenient than present.</p>
