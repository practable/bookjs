<h1>About Practable</h1>

<p>
This is the booking interface for the <a href="https://practable.io">practable.io</a> non-traditional practical work system, hosted by the University of Edinburgh. </p>

	<h3> For Users </h3>

	<p>The booking system, and the <a href="https://practable.io">practable.io</a> system itself, are under active development. You will notice functional and cosmetic changes over time. These should be largely self-explanatory.</p>
	

	<p> It's entirely possible you will find the odd issue, despite our best efforts to eliminate them. A simple page reload, or returning to the original link you received, should fix most of the issues that might crop up. We'd be delighted to hear from you if you have any other issues, or feedback. Just drop us a line at <a href="mailto:support@practable.io">support@practable.io</a> with as much detail as you can manage.</p>	  

	<h3> For Educators </h3>
	
	<p> Practable is the core reference implemention of an emerging consensus regarding the role of remote laboratories in on-campus education. Some of the background can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/23752696.2020.1816845">here</a>.</p>

	<h3> Adopters and Developers</h3>
	<p>	If you are a potential adopter or developer of federated remote laboratory technologies, you might be pleasantly surprised to find that all the code and hardware is open-source, for the complete feature set. We will continue to develop the code base in the open.  We value the opportunity to create educational software which reflects our values. We hope you do too.</p>

	<p> If you want to take a quick look at the software, you can find the core <a href="https://github.com/practable/relay">here</a>. Developer and adopter documentation is on our roadmap, as are support tools and services to set you up and/or keep you going / scale up. Alternatively, we can do some or all of the work for you - get in touch to discuss the options without obligation. If you have any questions, want to discuss getting some help, or simply want to let us know you might be interested in participating in the practable ecosystem in some way, let us know by emailing <a href="mailto:timothy.drysdale@ed.ac.uk">Tim</a>.</p>
